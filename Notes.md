We cant really use html tags inside native  like we do in react so we have components like [View](#view ) and [Text](#text)


# [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)

The most fundamental component for building a UI, View is a container that supports layout with [flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox), style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls. View maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a UIView, \<div>, android.view, etc.
# [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text)
A React component for displaying text.

Text supports nesting, styling, and touch handling.
