[Thoughts](#thoughts)

We can't really use html tags inside native like we do in react so we have components like [View](#view) and [Text](#text)


# [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)

The most fundamental component for building a UI, View is a container that supports layout with [flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox), style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls. View maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a UIView, \<div>, android.view, etc.
# [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text)
A React component for displaying text.

Text supports nesting, styling, and touch handling.


# Facts
anything you can do with react dom can be done with native
# Thoughts
it kinda bugs me that we can't give dimensions like 10px to something it's just 10 [read this](https://reactnative.dev/docs/height-and-width)  but its way better and we shouldn't [use px anyway](https://css-tricks.com/is-it-better-to-use-ems-rems-than-px-for-font-size/)
